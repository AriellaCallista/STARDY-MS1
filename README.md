Motivation: 
It is difficult to concentrate and ensure productivity when working on work individually. In addition, individuals are more prone to procrastination without someone monitoring them. The long and tedious school work also makes students burn out and lose motivation overtime. Having a source of encouragement and someone to support them will greatly boost their efficiency and lighten their stress load. 

The increasing consumption of instantly gratifying social media content (i.e. TikTok videos, YouTube shorts) has also made it more difficult for people to focus on doing their work as it does not provide them the instant gratification and dopamine shot they get from social media. It is not uncommon for people to even develop an addiction over these social media content and so making them unable to do their school work or sit down and study for extended periods. 

Vision: 
We hope to make an app that enables students to have an accountability partner to motivate and assist them to remain on track in their academics. Our proposed app aims to monitor and support students who desire to complete their tasks/goals but struggles to do so due to social media addiction and distractions. This app uses peer pressure positively to reduce procrastination and empower students to conquer their distractions. 

Scope of Project:  
STARdy is a productivity app aimed to tackle a specific issue interfering with university students’ productivity – procrastination. STARdy does this by matching users with an accountability partner who would help keep them accountable for their goals when teachers/parents no longer do, especially now that they are university students. Our classroom feature emulates that of a standard classroom, where we assign a task for users to submit evidence of their work, which will then be verified by their accountability partner. Users themselves also act as accountability partners themselves. The app utilizes peer influence positively and a gamified extension to improve user experience and productivity.
